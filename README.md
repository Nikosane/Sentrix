# Sentrix
Sentrix is a powerful IDS leveraging machine learning to detect intrusions and anomalies in network traffic. Combining signature-based and anomaly-based methods, it ensures robust protection against known and emerging threats, providing reliable, real-time network security.


## Objective:
This project aims to build an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning techniques to detect potential intrusions in network traffic. The system can be either signature-based (matching known attack patterns) or anomaly-based (detecting deviations from normal behavior).

## Skills Learned:
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Network security concepts
- Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

## Dataset:
This project uses the [KDD Cup 1999](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html) dataset, which is commonly used for network intrusion detection tasks.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nikosane/Sentrix.git
   cd Sentrix
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation:
jupyter notebook/Google colab
